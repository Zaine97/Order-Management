Project Overview

Welcome to the EcoPower Logistics Report project. This project involves the creation of a Power BI report designed to monitor and provide insights into EcoPower Logistics' customer orders and product sales. This README file will provide an overview of the project and guide stakeholders on how to use the report effectively.

EcoPower Logistics is a global logistics solutions provider that requires meticulous coordination of resources, orders, and goods. To streamline this process and provide valuable insights, we have developed a Power BI report that visualizes key information related to orders and products. This report is essential for decision-making and can be accessed by various stakeholders.
Report Purpose

The primary purpose of this Power BI report is to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of important data related to customer orders and product sales. This report is a powerful tool for monitoring and analyzing EcoPower Logistics' operations, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on real-time data.
Using the Report

Stakeholders can use the report to gain insights into the following key areas:
1. High-Level Metrics

    The "High-Level Metrics" page provides a summary view of crucial data points that can impact decision-making. This includes counts of key metrics and trends.

2. Order Monitoring

    The "Order Monitoring" page allows users to monitor orders from different perspectives:
        Orders Per Product: Visualizations that show the distribution of orders across various products.
        Orders Per Customer: Visualizations that help identify which customers are placing the most orders.
        Orders Over Time: Visualizations that track order trends over time, enabling stakeholders to identify patterns and make forecasts.

3. Product Monitoring

    The "Product Monitoring" page offers insights into EcoPower Logistics' product offerings:
        Product Inventory: Visualizations that display the number of products available.
        Product Metrics: Visualizations that showcase key product-related metrics to help understand the product portfolio.

4. Customer Monitoring

    The "Customer Monitoring" page allows stakeholders to analyze customer data:
        Customer Insights: Visualizations that provide insights into customer demographics and behaviors.

5. Filtering

    Throughout the report, you can utilize filters to refine the data presented in the visuals. Filters are available based on:
        Product Category: Filter the report based on product categories.
        Customer: Filter data to focus on specific customers.
        Order Number: Filter the report by order number for detailed analysis.
